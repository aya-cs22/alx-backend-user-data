# alx-backend-user-data

This repository is designed to manage user data within a backend application. Developed as part of the ALX Africa software engineering program, this project showcases backend development practices and provides a foundation for managing user-related data.


## 0x00. Personal data

This project focuses on managing personal data with a strong emphasis on security and privacy. It covers the handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), implementing logging mechanisms, and securing user passwords. 

## 0x01. Basic Authentication

This project focuses on implementing Basic Authentication for a simple API. It is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of authentication processes and how Basic Authentication works. 

## 0x02. Session authentication

In this project, you will implement a Session Authentication. You are not allowed to install any other module.
In the industry, you should not implement your own Session authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask: Flask-HTTPAuth). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.


## 0x03. User Authentication Service

This project focuses on implementing a user authentication system from scratch using Flask for educational purposes. The objective is to understand the underlying mechanisms of user authentication by building a basic system yourself. In a real-world scenario, it's recommended to use existing modules or frameworks (like Flask-User) to handle authentication securely.
