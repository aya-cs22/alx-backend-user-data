# 0x02. Session authentication

## Overview

In this project, you will implement a session authentication mechanism using Flask. This project focuses on understanding the concept of session authentication by building it from scratch. Although it is recommended in the industry to use existing modules or frameworks for such functionality (e.g. Flask-HTTPAuth)

### Background Context

In the industry, you should not implement your own Session authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask: Flask-HTTPAuth). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.
