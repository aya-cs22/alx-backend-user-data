# 0x03. User Authentication Service

## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing a user authentication system from scratch using Flask for educational purposes. The objective is to understand the underlying mechanisms of user authentication by building a basic system yourself. In a real-world scenario, it's recommended to use existing modules or frameworks (like Flask-User) to handle authentication securely.
