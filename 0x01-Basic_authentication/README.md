# 0x01. Basic Authentication

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing Basic Authentication for a simple API. It is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of authentication processes and how Basic Authentication works. 


### Background Context

In this project, you will learn about the authentication process and implement Basic Authentication on a simple API. Although it's not recommended to create your own authentication system in a real-world scenario (instead, using modules or frameworks like Flask-HTTPAuth in Python is advised), this exercise will guide you through each step of the Basic Authentication mechanism for educational purposes.

1. Explain what authentication means.
2. Describe what Base64 is.
3. Encode a string in Base64.
4. Understand what Basic Authentication is.
5. Send the Authorization header in an HTTP request.
